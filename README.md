# Titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster

This repository presents a solution to the Kaggle data science competition: 'Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster'. The notebook presents a full data science pipeline to predict whether passengers survived the disaster using data from a training set. The final solution achieves an accuracy of at least 83% (work is ongoing). The notebook consists of the following sections:

1. Problem statement
2. Data acquisition
3. Data exploration
4. Feature analysis
5. Data preparation
6. Model selection
7. Model tuning
8. Final model
